Hello! I am Sara, from Portugal! I love sailing, and I am passionate about Android programing!

# Can we Sail
App to check if weather conditions are ok to sail.

Whether you have a lake, a river or the ocean near you, this app will tell you if the wind and generic atmosphere conditions are good for some sailing!

There are 10 possibilities for european cities that you can select!

Retrieving weather from OpenWeather API

# Tecnologies used:
JetPack Compose library as part of a personal training that I am developing

HILT

Retrofit

Coil

# Disclaimer:

Openweather API don't provide hourly forecast as part of the free package. The forecast displayed in hour section DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO REALITY!

App under construction (started on January 23rd 2023)
ATM:

        edge cases and error views are not fully developed
        
        0% coverage with unit tests


# TODO's on the way
Implement swipe between home screen and details screens (unable to achieve it yet with jetpack Compose). Right now navigation between screens is achieved with a click.

Add city selection otpion and the ability to add / remove cities from the favorites.

Fix information displayed in hour section (with other free weather API?)
